@PURPOSE: Provide basic blocking and non-blocking networking facilities.

@MNEMONIC: Network Transport System (nts)

@DESCRIPTION: The 'nts' package group provides a suite of packages that wrap
and standardize the interface to the common, basic blocking and non-blocking
networking functionality provided by most operating systems. This functionality
roughly corresponds to that historically referred to as the Berkeley Sockets
API and the portions of POSIX related to networking, such as name resolution.

/Hierarchical Synopsis
/---------------------
 The 'nts' package group currently has 8 packages having 6 levels of physical
 dependency.  The list below shows the hierarchical ordering of the packages.
